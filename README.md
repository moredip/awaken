npm install
gulp 
open public/index.html

## TODOS
- finish todos example
 - refactor/cleanup of code duplication from implementing edit
 - figure out some way to componentize the editor component

 - save edit on lose focus
 - delete todo if editted to an empty string

 - UI-based tests
 - non-browser system tests
 - local storage?
